# Extreme_Poverty_Analyses.py

# The purpose of this program is to explore extreme poverty through the years. The program will ask for a
# year to give the user the countries with most of it's population in extreme poverty and the country with
# the least of its population in poverty. Later, the program will ask if the user would like to continue 
# exploring, this time, by country and proceed to show the years where the country had most of its population 
# in extreme poverty and the year where it had the least of its people in poverty.
